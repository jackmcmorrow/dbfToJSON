##DBF to JSON##
This is a small application to convert dBase *.DBF files into JSON files.

###JXCore###
The application was made in Node.js, however I decided to use a JXCore to create a native binary. As such, you will need it to compile (as of now) to any platform other than Windows(x64).

###Usage###

	dbfToJson-x64.exe path/to/dbf/file json/file/destination
